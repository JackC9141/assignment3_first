# Adding 2 integers together involves taking the first number, and adding 1 to it for however much the 2nd number is. EX: If I want to add 10 + 7, I would add 1 onto 10 until my 2nd number (7) reaches 0. In the end I would be left with 17

# EX2: Adding integers such as 132 and 153 requires adding each place, the hundreds are 1 + 1, the tens are 3 + 5, and the ones are 2 + 3, giving the end result of 285
